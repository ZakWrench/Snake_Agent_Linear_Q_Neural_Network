# Snake_Agent_Linear_Q_Neural_Network
This project trains an agent to play the game of Snake using a Linear Q Neural Network. The agent uses the network to predict the optimal moves to make, and learns through reinforcement learning.

Made following the following youtube video:[Python + PyTorch + Pygame Reinforcement Learning â€“ Train an AI to Play Snake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L8ypSXwyBds)
